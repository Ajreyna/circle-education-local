overview:
- title: Tech’s Diversity Problem
  text: The current makeup of the tech industry fails to represent the cultural makeup
    and trends of Austin, Texas and the United States as a whole. Our world is becoming
    more diverse by the day, and as tech plays an increasingly important role in
    shaping it, the tech workforce should represent this shift. Austin Coding Academy
    is committed to a diverse and representative tech workforce for the future.

- title: Implications for the Future
  text: The tech industry is instrumental in driving changes in our everyday life –
    from social networking, to smart homes and cars, to creating solutions to the
    biggest challenges we face in society. A tech workforce that truly represents how
    diverse we are, makes sure that all perspectives are considered in the solutions
    that we create.

- title: What We’re Doing to Help
  text: Since being founded in 2014, Austin Coding Academy has maintained a commitment
    to accessibility and affordability. Our Diversity Scholarship is another effort
    to make sure that we are promoting accessibility and diversity in tech, by making
    our transformative education available to even more well-qualified candidates.
