        <p>At Front, our mission has always been focused on bringing openness and transparency to the design process.
          We've always believed that by providing a space where designers can share ongoing work not only empowers them
          to make better products, it also helps them grow. We're proud to be a part of creating a more open culture
          and to continue building a product that supports this vision.</p>
        <p>As we've grown, we've seen how Front has helped companies such as Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and
          Intercom bring their designers closer together to create amazing things. We've also learned that when the
          culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and communicate with one another.</p>
        <p>That's why we are excited to share that we now have a <a href="#">free version of Front</a>, which will
          allow individual designers, startups and other small teams a chance to create a culture of openness early on.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="h5 mb-3">Bringing the culture of sharing to everyone.</h2>

      <p>Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can watch the design process unfold, both for
        themselves and for the people they work with â€“ no matter if it's a fellow designer, product manager, developer
        or client. Front allows you to invite more people into the process, creating a central place for conversation
        around design. As those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in how they communicate
        and work together.</p>

        <p>"Front allows us to collaborate in real time and is a really great way for leadership on the team to stay
          up-to-date with what everybody is working on," <a href="#">said</a> Stewart Scott-Curran, Intercom's Director
          of Brand Design.</p>
        <p>We know the power of sharing is real, and we want to create an opportunity for everyone to try Front and
          explore how transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a team of one or two designers and
          unlimited spectators (think PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design process
          earlier.</p>
