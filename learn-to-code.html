  description: "While both the terms are synonymous with each other and are often used interchangeably, they are quite different from each other. Coding simply means writing codes from one language to another such as from English to Java. Itâ€™s less intimidating and less intensive. Programming, on the other hand,means to program a machine with a set of instructions to run."
